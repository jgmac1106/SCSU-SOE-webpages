# SCSU-SOE-webpages
## History
I originally updated the page but we were using a fixed size of 630opx for content. In December we updated to bootstrap. This semester I was given 1.5 credits to update everything. My goal is to make it pretty but still editable by every department in the School of Education.
## How to Use these Pages
There is alot of extra cruff from our CMS. If you want the bootstrap only juts grab all the content in the maincontent tag. You will also need the CSS in the file. Though as these files gets updated to bootstrap, hopefully these will be needed less.
## FacultyBioPage
I want this to be a portable business card for faculty across our web properties. Using bootstrap and some font awesome I hope to make a business card between to divs that could go on any website using bootstrap. Right now I have updated the layout, now I have to remove all the pixel based design. This will mean learning best practices for making boxes in bootstrap. I wish I could provide attribution to the original template I found. It is really mixed together from a bunch of thigns and I lost the history. If it looks familiar to anyone please let me know.
