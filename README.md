# SCSU-SOE-webpages
##History
I originally updated the page but we were using a fixed size of 630opx for content. In December we updated to bootstrap. This semester I was given 1.5 credits to update everything. My goal is to make it pretty but still editable by every department in the School of Education.
##FacultyBioPage
I want this to be a portable business card for faculty across our web properties. Using bootstrap and some font awesome I hope to make a business card between to divs that could go on any website using bootstrap. Right now I have updated the layout, now I have to remove all the pixel based design. This will mean learning best practices for making boxes in bootstrap. I wish I could provide attribution to the original template I found. It is really mixed together from a bunch of thigns and I lost the history. If it looks familiar to anyone please let me know.
##Vita Page
A one page layout for each faculty member. This should be pretty easy to layout in columns.
